UNLOCK ALGORITHM EXPLAINED
*--------------------------------------------------------*


Terms Explained:

IMEI:
A 15 digits number which uniquely identifies a phone. Usually found under the battery

NCK Code:
The unlock code which can be used to unlock a network-locked phone so that it can be
used on any network. The NCK is calculated using the IMEI

Unlock Key:
This is a number which is , well, magical . It is used in step 4 of the algorithm,
as explained below

How the Algorithm Works:

Given a 15 digits, valid IMEI number

1 - Calculate the sum of the last 13 IMEI digits

2 - For each digit in the IMEI , multiply it with the sum from step 1 and compute
the remainder after dividing it by 10. This is called the 'First Multiplier'

3 - For each digit in the IMEI, multiply it by 8 and compute the remainder after
dividing it by 10. This is then reversed and is called the 'Second Multiplier'

4 - For each digit in the imei, get the corresponding unlock code digit from the
    unlock key, add first & second multipliers to it and then concatenate all these
    to get one long unlock code. This is the unlock code
